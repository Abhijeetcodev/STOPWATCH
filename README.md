To run the app on their machine, the following steps need to be followed:

1.Package.json and Node Modules:

Make sure the project directory contains the package.json file, which includes information about the project and its dependencies.
In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory.
Run the command npm install to install the project dependencies specified in the package.json file.
This command will create a node_modules directory in the project directory, containing all the installed dependencies.
Running the App:

2.After the dependencies are installed, start the app by using the command npm start or npx react-native start.
This command will initiate the Metro bundler, which is responsible for bundling the JavaScript code and assets for the app.
Running on a Device or Emulator:

3.Connect a physical device or start an emulator/simulator for the target platform (Android or iOS).
For Android, use the command npx react-native run-android.
For iOS, use the command npx react-native run-ios.
This command will build the app and install it on the connected device or emulator.
